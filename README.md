# Range Extension plugin for UE4

Because Unreal Engine is missing blueprint functions for FFloatRange and FInt32Range, this plugins add them.
This way, you can use nativization with FFloatRange and FInt32Range

Needs a C++ project.
Add the repository to your Plugins folder, and enable it through the editor.
